# twitterbot
python files for a bot that will like and retweet post for you,.

create a developer account at developer.twitter.com so you can get your API Key and Access Token.

Tweepy makes this much easier. The last twitterbot I wrote had to make use of an external program and web browser - but not with tweepy!
